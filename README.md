# Reinforcement-Learning---Policy-and-Value-Iteration
Making use of Policy Iteration and Value Iteration algorithms to solve a simple MDP problem.

The environment is a simple MDP problem formulated as:
States: Happy, Sad
Actions: Studying, Drinking
Rewards: ranges between -10 and 40 depending on the transition

We explore Policy and Value Iteration algorithms to obtain the best possible policy for this particuar MDP.
We also explore the probability of transitioning from some initial state to some other state at time t = 1,2,3.

In order to observe the results, please keep all the files in the same folder and make sure to run main.py only.
